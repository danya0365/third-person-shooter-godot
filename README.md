## 🌍 The Vision

**Project Vanguard** is a next-generation Third-Person Shooter (TPS) currently in active development using **Godot Engine 4.4**.

We are not just building a controller; we are crafting a **World Class Action Experience**. Our goal is to push the boundaries of open-source game development, delivering AAA-quality mechanics, responsive controls, and high-fidelity gameplay systems.

This project serves as the foundation for a tactical shooter that prioritizes:
*   **Fluidity**: Seamless transitions between movement and combat.
*   **Immersion**: A camera system that feels like a cinematic extension of the player.
*   **Scalability**: Built on a modular architecture designed for complex AI and multiplayer networking.

## ⚡ Core Systems (v0.1)

The foundation has been laid. Our current build features:

### 🛡️ Fluid Gameplay Architecture
Powered by a robust **State Machine**, the character controller handles complex logic without spaghetti code.
- **Dynamic State Handling**: Idle, Run, Jump, and Air Physics blended seamlessly.
- **Scalable Design**: Ready to integrate Crouch, Slide, Cover, and Melee systems.

### 🎥 Cinematic Camera Suite
A professional-grade camera rig (`SpringArm3D`) designed for modern action standards.
- **Smart Shoulder Swapping**: Tactical view switching (Left/Right) for corner peeking.
- **Dynamic Aim Zoom**: Smooth FOV transitions for precision targeting.
- **Intelligent Collision**: Automatically adjusts to environment geometry to maintain view.

### 🏃 High-Fidelity Movement
- **Inertia & Momentum**: Physics-based acceleration and deceleration for realistic weight.
- **Sprint Mechanics**: Dynamic speed scaling with impactful visual feedback.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap (Road to v1.0)

We have an ambitious journey ahead. Here is our plan to achieve World Class status:

### Phase 1: Combat Evolution (In Progress) ⚔️
*   **Advanced Ballistics**: Implementation of hitscan and projectile weapon systems.
*   **Weapon Feel**: Procedural recoil, sway, and dynamic crosshair spread.
*   **ADS Mechanics**: Precise iron-sight and scope handling.

### Phase 2: Tactical Depth 🛡️
*   **Cover System**: Context-aware cover entry, corner peeking, and blind fire.
*   **Advanced Mobility**: Tactical slides, dodge rolls, and parkour vaulting.
*   **CQC Integration**: Melee takedowns and close-quarters combat.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Adversaries 🤖
*   **Next-Gen AI**: Behavior Trees driving squad tactics, flanking, and suppression.
*   **Boss Battles**: Multi-stage encounters with unique mechanics.

### Phase 4: Polish & Multiplayer 🌐
*   **Networked Warfare**: Godot High-Level Multiplayer implementation.
*   **Visual Fidelity**: High-end VFX (particles, lighting) and post-processing.
*   **Immersive Audio**: Spatial soundscapes and dynamic audio occlusion.
